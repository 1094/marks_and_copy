# About

This is [lighttigerXIV's ulauncher-bookmarks extension](https://github.com/lighttigerXIV/ulauncher-bookmarks/) tweaked to copy instead of open. I've also changed the icons (they are pretty poorly done, I'm hoping to update them in the future).

# How to use
## Adding a bookmark
To add a bookmark you just need to type in the following order:

`{keyword} add {url} as {name}`

## Removing a bookmark
To remove a bookmark you just need to type in the following order:

`{keyword} remove {name}`

## Copy a bookmark
To copy a bookmark you just need to type the following:

`{keyword} {name}`

## Editing 
To edit the bookmarks you need to manually edit them in their respective file. It's located in `~/.config/marks.json`


## To do:
[X] Only works on Wayland, add xclip subprocess for X11.  
[] Clean up icon images.  
[] Fix code so user set icons show up in results list.
